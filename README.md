# Presentation.Html5.Today

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **HTML5 and CSS - Let's enhance the
web today**

## Abstract

The news is all about HTML5 these days but how about your company? HTML5, especially in combination
with CSS3, can do amazing thing to your web site but many companies are still hesitant to jump on
the train. The jump doesn't have to be that big though. If you only know how, when and where it
should be used you can do really cool things without even breaking your site in older browsers.

After showing the basic techniques Joakim will walk you through his five favourite techniques in
HTML5 and show a live demo of how each of these techniques can be used today.

## Known issues

* The presentation crashes Safari for iPad.
* The presentation doesn't work in Internet Explorer and Opera.
* The presentation doesn't look good in Firefox.
* The source code doesn't show in Chrome unless served from a web server.

Long story short: It's made for Safari, I present it using Safari so Safari is probably the best
way to watch this presentation :-) Maybe I'll fix it in the future, maybe not.
